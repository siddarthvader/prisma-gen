Inside the `src` folder, create a new folder called `models`.\n\n4. Create a new file called `schema.prisma` inside the `models` folder, and define your Prisma schema there.\n\n5. Create a new folder called `workflows` inside the `src` folder. This is where your event handlers and workflows will go.\n\n6. Create a new file called `index.js` inside the `workflows` folder. This file will be the entry point for your microservice.\n\n7. Inside the `workflows` folder, create a new sub-folder for each entity in your Prisma schema. For example, if you have an entity called `MenuItem`, create a new folder called `menu-item` inside the `workflows` folder.\n\n8. Inside each entity sub-folder, create a new file for each event that you want to handle. For example, if you want to handle a `GET` request for menu items, create a new file called `get-menu-item.js`.\n\n9. In each event handler file, write the event specification in Godspeed's YAML format, as per the documentation at docs.godspeed.systems.\n\n10.

The tasks within a workflow can perform a variety of operations, such as calling external services, manipulating data, or sending notifications.\n\nSo, to define an HTTP GET event for fetching the menu of a restaurant in Godspeed format, you would create an event definition file in the `events/` directory.

The event will be triggered when a message is received on the `menu` topic, using the `kafka-menu` datasource. The `fn` property specifies the name of the event handler function, which will be called when the event is triggered. The `on_validation_error` property specifies the name of the validation error handler function to be called if the event fails validation. \n\nThe `body` property of the Kafka event specification defines the expected message body of the Kafka event in Swagger format. In this example, the message body is expected to be a JSON object with two properties: `restaurant_id` and `menu`. The `restaurant_id` property is a string that specifies the ID of the restaurant for which the menu data is being sent. The `menu` property is an array of objects, where each object represents a menu item with properties such as `name`, `description`, `price`, and `category`.\n\nWhen the event is triggered, the message body of the Kafka event will be passed to the `process_menu_event` function as `inputs.body`.

I hope you are doing well. Heard about the incident in China. I hope it is under control now.\n\nAkshar called me and said you have requested an explaination for the evaluation which behind our proposal for your investment as the very first investor: i.e. 2.5% shares in current investment round, for $125k.\n \nLet me first thankyou for considering this. Let me now share our reason behind . \n\nProduct validation: We know that the market needs what we have. We are filling a huge gap. Here is a video of case study by Pinelabs, our enterprise customer in fintech. How they gained 50-80% productivity gain. We are getting more work from them this year, including support and services around our software.\nhttps://youtu.be/in64WNtUwBE\n\nCustomer base\nWe have 20 warm leads in our pipeline. There are more than 2 million busineses which use tech in some form. We will try to reach out to selected 10000 in first year, through different marketing and partnership channels running in an automated fashion.\n\nRevenue\nOur previous year revenue was around $200k. This included services around our product.\n\nProjections:\nOur customer base, revenue and profit projection for best case and worst case scenario is attached with this email, in a picture. The shown revenue does not include services, which we will be doing atleast in year 1. The revenue calculation here includes monthly subscription of our software, one time setup cost of platform (optional), and one staffed engineer per customer on avg.\n\nYear 1: Our worst case estimation is 65 customers in one year with breaking even (if we include services). A happy case is 100 customers with a profit of $300k (13%), excluding the services profit.  I am attaching a sheet which not only shows the financial model but also different channels through which we will be acquiring, so that you know the models on which we are basing our assumptions customer acquisition.\n\nInvestment\nWe have lined up atleast 3 interested micro vcs and larger VCs aiming to close the deal with us by next week. Once the first one comes (after you), the rest will follow in herd mentality in fear of missing out. (That is how they work).  I have been invited to Bangalore for final meetings. They will invest anywhere from 0.5m$ to 1m$ each, totalling not more than $2m (unless they start to do counter bidding which they do) They will get around 15% for the same, as expected today. They may increase the investment amount to get 15-20%. Assuming realistically that they take around 15% for 1.5M$, you are getting a return of 2.5X within a week of your confirmation.\n\nPlease, let me also add that we are very confident that even with $125k coming from you, we should be in good shape to scale this year. We are only talking with them because A. They approached us by hearing about us and B. They will help us find customers internationally through channel partnerships, and their own portfolio companies. They will be like an extended team.\n\nAlex, you can read about Hasura, this company in comparative category. They are more than $1 billion valuation in just 5 years. You can read their story. They don\u2019t even make revenues! Just because their software is popular they became highly valued. What we have is a disruption in the way products will be made. And your initial investment gives us a bridge to build this, even with a tight budget. And it gives us leverage to talk to next investors and get a good deal from them.\n\nYour return is immediate and assured the moment they come, whether in one week. Or in future, max in 5 years when we do an IPO. If you wish to exit in 3 years, I am confident we will be able to give you a 5-10X return easily, even from our own profit. And most probably some big investor at a later stage may want to buy you out.\n\nSo in all, I believe this is a low risk and a great opportunity to invest. If you consider putting more than $125k, we can discuss that too. \n"]}, "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}], "create_time": null, "update_time": null}, "conversation_id": "4cb400bb-291d-4e8d-a168-4bb4e12e95ac"}, "output": {"feedback_version": "inline_regen_feedback:a:1.0", "ui_feature_name": "inline_regen_feedback", "ui_feature_variant": "a", "ui_feature_version": "1.0", "feedback_step_1": {"rating": "none", "critique_text": "", "tags": []}, "feedback_step_2": {"original_turn": [{"id": "ce99fc68-30aa-4643-baf9-8f4a82d0b8f5", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null}, "create_time": 1682514809.361495, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Dear Alex,\n\nIt was great connecting with you, and I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to explain the evaluation behind our proposal for your investment as the very first investor: 2.5% shares in the current investment round for $125k.\n\nThank you for considering this opportunity. Here are our reasons for the investment:\n\nProduct validation: We have validated the need for our product and filled a significant gap in the market. Our enterprise customer in fintech, Pinelabs, gained a 50-80% productivity increase using our software. We have secured more work from them this year, including support and services around our software.\n\nCustomer base: We have 20 warm leads in our pipeline and are targeting 10,000 selected businesses in the first year through various automated marketing and partnership channels.\n\nRevenue: Our previous year's revenue was around $200k, including services around our product.\n\nProjections: Our best and worst-case scenarios for customer base, revenue, and profit are attached to this email. The revenue projection includes monthly subscriptions to our software, one-time setup cost of the platform (optional), and one staffed engineer per customer on average.\n\nInvestment: We have lined up at least three interested micro VCs and larger VCs aiming to close the deal by next week. Once the first one comes, the rest will follow in herd mentality, afraid of missing out. They will invest anywhere from $500k to $1m each, totaling not more than $2m. They will receive around 15% for the same, as expected today. They may increase the investment amount to get 15-20%. Realistically assuming they take around 15% for $1.5M, you can expect a return of 2.5X within a week of your confirmation.\n\nWe are confident that even with $125k coming from you, we can scale this year. We are only talking with the VCs because they approached us, and they will help us find customers internationally through channel partnerships and their own portfolio companies.\n\nYour initial investment gives us a bridge to build this, even with a tight budget. And it gives us leverage to talk to the next investors and get a good deal from them. Your return is immediate and assured the moment the VCs come. If you wish to exit in three years, we are confident we will be able to give you a 5-10X return easily, even from our own profit.\n\nIn all, this is a low-risk opportunity to invest. If you consider investing more than $125k, we can discuss that too. Thank you again for your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards, \n[Your name]"]}, "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}], "completion_comparison_rating": "new", "new_completion_placement": "not-applicable", "feedback_start_time": 1682514778800, "compare_step_start_time": 1682514778800, "new_completion_load_start_time": 1682514778800000, "new_completion_load_end_time": 1682515101510, "frontend_submission_time": 1682515110199}}, "metadata": {"is_paid_user": false, "cf_headers": {"cf-ipcity": "Dharamsala", "cf-ipcountry": "IN", "cf-ipcontinent": "AS", "oai-asnum": "9829", "oai-subdivision-1-iso-code": "IN-HP", "cf-visitor": "{\"scheme\":\"https\"}", "cf-verified-bot": "false", "cf-threat-score": "0", "cf-bot-score": "99"}}, "create_time": "2023-04-26T13:18:30.798611+00:00"}]
